defmodule ProblemB do
  @moduledoc """
  This problem is conceptually similar to the last one except that GenServer is used. As such, we start with `start_link/1` passing in the map which then calls `init/1` to initialize the server. After that, the logic is the same except that
  that we need to implement the synchronous handle_call/3 function. handle_call/3 is a blocking call and it returns a 2, 3 or 4-tuple. In this case, it returns `{:reply, resp, state}` to send the response to the caller. Again, the caller pattern matches
  on the response and raises on error.
